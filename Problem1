If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

var totalsum = 0;
    for (var counteronebyone = 0 ; counteronebyone < 1000  ; counteronebyone++) {
        if (counteronebyone % 3 == 0 || counteronebyone % 5 == 0) {
            totalsum += counteronebyone;
            console.log("the counter is in: " + counteronebyone + " and the sum is equal to: " + totalsum)
        } else {
            console.log("the counter is: " + counteronebyone + " and the sum is still: " + totalsum);
        }
    }
